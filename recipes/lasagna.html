    <h1>Unknown Meat Lasagna</h1>

    <h5><em>I'll be honest, guys...I have no idea where I got this meat from.</em></h5>
    <img src="../images/garfLasagna.jpg" alt="Garf with lasagna" style="width: 550px;">
    <p>On September 8, 2022, Queen Elizabeth II died. To some, this represented a larger reference to a perhaps more significant event in history, namely the second live-action Garfield movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0455499/"><em>"Garfield: A Tail of Two Kitties".</em></a></p>
    </p>
    <p>In the film, Garfield utilizes his (perhaps unrightfully earned) royal abilities to have his subordinantes prepared a large lasagna feast for the animals. This recipe attempts to replicate this lasagna fit for a king.</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>  12 whole wheat lasagna noodles</li>
        <li>  1 pound lean ground beef</li>
        <li>  2 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
        <li>  1 teaspoon dried oregano, or to taste</li>
        <li>  ½ teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>  salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
        <li>  1 (16 ounce) package cottage cheese</li>
        <li>  ½ cup shredded Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>  2 eggs</li>
        <li>  4 ½ cups tomato-basil pasta sauce</li>
        <li>  2 cups shredded mozzarella cheese</li>  
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat up your oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li> <li>Get a big pot of water boiling with a pinch of salt. Toss in your lasagna noodles and cook them for about 10 minutes until they're just right; then, drain them.</li> <li>While the noodles are cooking, throw some ground beef, garlic, oregano, garlic powder, salt, and pepper into a large skillet on medium heat. Cook and stir until the beef is all crumbly and browned, which usually takes around 10 minutes.</li> <li>In a big bowl, mix together cottage cheese, Parmesan cheese, and eggs until it's all nicely combined.</li> <li>Line the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking pan with 4 noodles. Layer on some tomato-basil sauce, then the beef mixture, followed by the cottage cheese mix. Repeat these layers twice more, finishing with a sauce layer on top. Sprinkle some mozzarella cheese over it all. Cover the dish with foil.</li> <li>Pop it in the oven and bake until the lasagna is bubbling and the cheese is all melty, which usually takes about 30 minutes. Take off the foil and bake a bit longer until the cheese starts to brown, around 10 more minutes. Let it sit for at least 10 minutes before digging in (like Garfield).</li>
